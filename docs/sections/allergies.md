####Notes
- Name and code are optional in the spec.  In this model we assume they are required.
- Allergies can be translated using translation object.
- All fields except date are based on allergy observation.  Date is based on Problem Act.
- Observations can be multiple in the spec.  In this model they are assumed to be unique.
- Observation and reactions have dates independent of problem act in the spec.  They are ignored in this model.
- All text fields are ignored.
- Severities can have interpretation codes.  These are ignored in this model.
- Status comes from observation status.  Problem Act status is ignored.
- Reaction Procedure Activity and Medication Activity relationships are ignored.
