[JSON/XML sample](samples/immunizations.md)


####Notes
- 'code' may come in, but not on samples and it doesn't define why, so not currently supported.
- statusCode comes in, but doesn't seem to mean anything.  It is 'completed' in all examples.
- series, performer, reaction, and refusal reason all seem to be optional.
- medication series number is either the number administered in a series, or the number to be in pending immunizations; captured as 'sequence_number.'
- Route code should come from one dataset, but is another in all the samples without a translation object.  Will need to support coded entries as such since the standard is contradictory.
- Only supporting manufacturer name for now.  I believe this can have more information attached.
- Performer just a wrapper for assignedEntity.
- Not supported: patient instructions, precondition, medication supply order, medication dispense, reaction.

####Immunization.date
- 0..2
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/effectiveTime
- Should be handled to account for each type of date.

####Immunization.identifiers
- 1..*
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/id

####Immunization.status
- 1..1
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration@moodCode
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration@negationInd
- Combination of mood code and negation can determine status of either 'pending', 'refused', or 'complete'.

####Immunizations.name
- 1..1
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/consumable/manufacturedProduct/manufacturedMaterial/code@displayName
- Using display name, all of these should be coming in as CVX coded, so no need for code system.  Might want to normalize them.

####Immunizations.code
- 1..1
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/consumable/manufacturedProduct/manufacturedMaterial/code@code
- All of these should be coming in as CVX coded, so no need for code system.  Might want to normalize them.

####Immunization.sequence_number
- 0..1
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/repeatNumber@value
- See notes for significance.

####Immunizations.product
- 0..1
- No direct mapping
- This is a catch all for every non-primary attribute of the product.  All elements herein are optional at this point.

####Immunizations.product.translations
- 0..*
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/consumable/manufacturedProduct/manufacturedMaterial/code/translation
- This is a coded set and should be supported as such.  Allows for synonyms in the same or other code sets.

####Immunizations.product.lot_number
- 0..1
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/consumable/manufacturedProduct/manufacturedMaterial/lotNumberText

####Immunizations.product.manufacturer
- 0..1
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/consumable/manufacturedProduct/manufacturerOrganization/name
- May support more than just a name element, not sure.  However, just supporting name for now.

####Immunization.administration
- 0..1
- No direct mapping
- This is a catch all for every non-primary attribute of the product's delivery.  All elements herein are optional at this point.

####Immunization.administration.route
- 0..1
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/routeCode
- Coded entry, should be treated like the rest.

####Immunization.administration.body_site
- 0..1
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/approachSiteCode/@value
- Always coded to SNOMED-CT if present.
- No demo files, can fake it for now and take displayName.

####Immunization.administration.quantity
- 0..1
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/doseQuantity
- This is a value/units pair, where units aren't required.
- If they do come in, they are picked from '2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.12839'

####Immunization.administration.form
- 0..1
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/administrationUnitCode
- This must be picked from 2.16.840.1.113883.3.88.12.3221.8.11.
- This code set is probably small enough to keep in memory (~200 entries).

####Immunization.performer
- 0..1
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/performer/assignedEntity
- http://www.cdapro.com/know/26953 <-- helpful link.
- This object is impossible; there is practically no information on it's structure in the standard.
- assignedEntity seems to be the defacto element within, which is also poorly documented.
- Will attempt to parse what I can based on demo files.  Everything under here is highly speculative.

####Immunization.performer.identifiers
- 0..*
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/performer/assignedEntity/id

####Immunization.performer.address
- 0..1
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/performer/assignedEntity/addr
- Need to write a standard address parser for this element, should be used in demographics, etc. as well.
- Lack of spec makes assumption, one address for this performer.

####Immunization.performer.phone
- 0..*
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/performer/assignedEntity/telecom
- Need to write a standard address parser for this element, should be used in demographics, etc. as well.

####Immunization.performer.email
- 0..*
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/performer/assignedEntity/telecom
- Need to write a standard address parser for this element, should be used in demographics, etc. as well.

####Immunization.performer.name
- 0..1?
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/performer/assignedEntity/assignedPerson/name
- Need to write a standard address parser for this element, should be used in demographics, etc. as well.
- Lack of spec makes assumption, one name for this performer.

####Immunization.performer.organization
- 0..*
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/performer/assignedEntity/representedOrganization
- Inferred from standard only.

####Immunization.performer.organization.name
- 0..*
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/performer/assignedEntity/representedOrganization/name
- Should just be name value, no need for structured name.

####Immunization.performer.organization.phone
- 0..*
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/performer/assignedEntity/representedOrganization/telecom
- Need to write a standard address parser for this element, should be used in demographics, etc. as well.

####Immunization.performer.organization.email
- 0..*
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/performer/assignedEntity/representedOrganization/telecom
- Need to write a standard address parser for this element, should be used in demographics, etc. as well.

####Immunization.performer.organization.address
- 0..*
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/performer/assignedEntity/representedOrganization/addr
- Need to write a standard address parser for this element, should be used in demographics, etc. as well.

####Immunization.performer.organization.identifiers
- 0..*
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/performer/assignedEntity/representedOrganization/id

####Immunization.refusal_reason
- 0..1
- /ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/substanceAdministration/entryRelationship/observation/code@displayName
- Should probably be recoded, set small enough.  2.16.840.1.113883.5.8
